	// If a retried function fails, the connection will be closed, then the program sleeps for an increasing amount of time,

		// or the email addresses are malformed (like, missing parts of the address), then it is skipped
		// If an email is found, then an imap.Email struct slice is returned with the information from the email.
		// The Email struct looks like this:
		// type Email struct {
		// 	Flags     []string
		// 	Received  time.Time
		// 	Sent      time.Time
		// 	Size      uint64

		// 	ReplyTo   EmailAddresses
		// 	CC        EmailAddresses
		// 	BCC       EmailAddresses
		// 	Text      string
		// 	HTML      string
		//	Attachments []Attachment
		// }
		// Where the address type fields are maps like [EmailAddress:Name EmailAddress2:Name2]
		// and an Attachment is a struct containing the Name, Content, and the MimeType (both as strings)
		emails, err := im.GetEmails(uids...)
